Docker based fan controller. Note this is still early in the developement phase. I appreciate all comments/feedback/bug reports.
Currently supports:
- iDRAC7
- iDRAC8
- iDRAC9 (offset control only)
- iLO4 (must be running unlocked version)
- Supermicro X9
- Supermicro X10
- Supermicro X11
- SMART (drive temperatures only obviously)

I am hoping to add more control/sensors in the future.

For installing see docker-compose for reference.
